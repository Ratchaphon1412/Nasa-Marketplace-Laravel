## Challenge

### A Marketplace for Open Science Projects

There are many different open science and open-source projects and tools, but no efficient way to match project creators with interested collaborators who possess the skills required to contribute. Your challenge is to create a solution that will help people who are looking for open-source projects to work on and project creators who need skilled contributors to find each other and communicate.

# HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY

I am developed a web application that connects open science project creators with skilled potential contributors. This addresses the challenge of finding skilled collaborators for open science projects, which often require a wide range of skills and expertise. The app allows project creators to search for collaborators based on skills and interests, and it suggests project creator-collaborator pairings based on information entered by each party. The app also provides a way for individuals and project creators to communicate privately. This app is important because it helps to accelerate the progress of open science by making it easier for people from all backgrounds to contribute to open science projects. This can lead to new discoveries and innovations.
